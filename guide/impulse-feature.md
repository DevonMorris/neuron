# Impulse

:::{.ui .message}
Impulse is a very new feature[^gh], which is to be improved with more useful graph querying capabilities in the coming months.
:::

Impulse is the dynamic part of the otherwise statically-generated [[web]]. 

It displays the zettelkasten [[folgezettel-heterarchy]] for all [[[2012301]]] in the zettelkasten graph, as well provides a way to filter them by searching.

View this site's impulse [here](./impulse.html). You can also tap the `/` or `s` key to open impulse from anywhere.

[^gh]: See [github issue](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/108#issuecomment-706484958) for background information.
