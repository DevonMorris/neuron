Neuron was designed with these criteria in mind:

* **Future-proof**: store notes locally[^plain] as *plain-text* (Markdown) files
* Not tied[^editor] to a single text editor
* Statically generated web site, for browsing and publishing on the web
* Remain as simple to use as possible, whilst being feature-rich via [[Plugins]]

[^plain]: Store your notes however you want. We recommend [Git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), which enables full revision history of your notes for lifetime.
[^editor]: Text editors should ideally be *decoupled*, integrating via something like [LSP](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/213). Both Emacs and Vim have extensions for neuron (see [[Editor integration]]).
