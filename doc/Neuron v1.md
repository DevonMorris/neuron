Current development version (v2) of neuron breaks compatibility in many cases (such as dropping org-mode support). If you would like these features, consider staying with version 1 of neuron. You can install this version using:

```shell
nix-env -if https://github.com/srid/neuron/archive/v1.tar.gz
```

If you would like to contribute org support to v2, see [this issue](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/557).
