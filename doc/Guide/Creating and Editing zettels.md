# Creating and Editing zettels

You may use any text editor with Markdown support to edit your zettel files. Neuron provides a command to create new zettel files with the suitable [[id]]:

```bash
neuron new
```

This command will print the path to the file created. Use `-e` to also open the text editor:

```bash
neuron new -e
```

Do not forget to link your new zettel to the rest of your Zettelkasten. See [[linking]].

## Opening a Zettel by title

See [[searching]].

## Using a text editor

See [[[editor]]]

## Web Interface

[[[cerveau]]] provides a web interface to browse and edit your Neuron v1 notes.
