An **uplink** is a special kind of backlink created using [[Folgezettel Links]]. An **uplink tree** (aka. "uptree") of a zettel is the subset of the [[folgezettel-heterarchy]] which branch off to the zettel. Uplink tree is displayed immediately above the zettel's title; all backlinks of the zettel are displayed immediately below the zettel's content.
